This code reads in liquid compositions from a user-tagged generic spreadsheet, and
calculates equilibrium plagioclase compositions. Results - with data labels - are automatically clipped to the clipboard

Instructions are given in 
  -the spreadsheet "Step1_TagThisMasterSpreadsheet" for tagging your own spreadsheet of liquid compositions in worksheet "InputData"
  -the matlab file "Step2_RunThisMasterCode" for running the code
  
  
I recommend first running the example by running the script "Step2_RunThisMasterCode" and making sure you reproduce the same results as pre-pasted in the worksheet "PastedResults" in "Step1_TagThisMasterSpreadsheet"
